# On Your Terms

A how-to guide for chasing thatdream job and making it yours.

## Description

My career kicked off quite by accident.

Having taken a job with family out of a motivation for money to support my schooling, I hadn't tremendous passion or ambition with my first serious employer. Not withstanding, the years ticked by and I find both passion and ambition.

Over the span of eight years with that employer, I received my degree and amassed a half decade of industry experience. I discovered it was time for me to take my career by the horns and blaze a new trail. Having started my career without a plan, I was ready for a career on my terms.

Following a lengthy process of preparation and a multi-month job hunt, I settled into a new career opportunity I had only dreamed of.

The purpose of this resource is to share what I learned to help YOU have the same success. I recommend reading through all the sections and then crafting a plan that follows the principles to best suit your situation.

I'm confident you'll find what you're looking for, as I did.
